1. **Benford deviation gradient:** Compute d(delta_B)/dr across the horizon. The trajectory data suggests delta_B increases from ~0.004 at the horizon to ~0.017 at r/r_s = 0.1. Determine whether this gradient correlates with the logarithmic derivative ζ'/ζ, which would establish a direct link between Benford deviation and the rate of prime structure breakdown.

2. **Ricci scalar decomposition:** Compute R and the Weyl scalar C_μνρσ C^μνρσ separately. Check whether the Benford deviation delta_B tracks Weyl curvature (tidal forces) more closely than Ricci curvature (matter content).

3. **Prime corrections:** Investigate whether subleading terms in the Laurent expansion of ζ(s) = 1/(s-1) + γ + γ₁(s-1) + ... produce testable deviations from exact Schwarzschild near the horizon. If corrections exist, they should appear as systematic shifts in the Benford per-digit deviations ε(d).

4. **Functional equation mapping:** Determine whether the symmetry s ↔ 1-s (which maps the exterior to the interior through the critical line s = 1/2) has physical meaning. If so, the Riemann Hypothesis — all non-trivial zeros at Re(s) = 1/2 — would imply all interior resonances lie on a single surface. Check whether delta_B has any special behavior at the s = 1/2 surface.

5. **L'Hôpital analysis:** Apply L'Hôpital's Rule to ζ'/ζ and ζ''/ζ ratios at s = 1 to evaluate limits of curvature expressions in the s-parameterization.

6. **Near-horizon observables:** The angular metric component g_θθ = r² · ζ(s) produces massive angular stretching near the horizon (factor of ζ ≈ 100 at r = 1.01r_s). Determine whether this angular anisotropy produces signatures detectable by the Event Horizon Telescope or future VLBI experiments at r ≈ 1.4r_s.

7. **Formalize the three-tier hierarchy:** The observation that prime structure (Euler product), analytic structure (functional equation), and statistical structure (Benford conformance) give different answers at the horizon suggests a formal hierarchy of geometric descriptions. Determine whether this hierarchy has an information-theoretic interpretation — e.g., the Euler product encodes maximal structure, Benford conformance encodes minimal structure, and the analytic continuation sits between them.

8. **Double-slit δ_B measurement:** Design an experiment to measure Benford deviation across physical quantities in a double-slit setup. The prediction: δ_B increases when which-path detection is active, and the increase correlates with the Englert-Greenberger distinguishability parameter D. This would test whether wave function collapse is a continuous slide along the mass-quantum spectrum.

9. **Bridge factor validation:** Compute the bridge factor ε_B = |1-2^(1-s)| for photon systems at various energies and compare with observed δ_B in quantum optics experiments. Determine whether the horizon crossing point (where δ_B > ε_B) has any analog in laboratory-scale quantum systems.

10. **BEC-to-black-hole mapping:** The mass-quantum profile of the black hole interior ([Section 8.5](08-benford-epsilon.md)) shows the same spectrum that the BEC paper found in quantum statistics. Determine whether the radial profile δ_B(r) inside a black hole can be mapped to a temperature profile T(r) via the BEC paper's thermal Benford relation.
