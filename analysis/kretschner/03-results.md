## 3.1 The Prime Framework Reproduces Finite Horizon Curvature

Because the vacuum Einstein equations uniquely determine f(r) = 1 - r_s/r given the constraint g_tt · g_rr = -1, the Kretschner scalar in the prime framework is **identical** to standard Schwarzschild:

> K_prime = K_Schwarzschild = 12r_s²/r⁶

This holds at all radii, including the horizon. The curvature is finite at r = r_s.

## 3.2 The Implicit s(r) Mapping

Numerical inversion of ζ(s) = r/(r - r_s) reveals the behavior of the implicit mapping:

| r/r_s | s(r) | ζ(s) | Regime |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| 1.001 | ≈ 1.001 | 1001 | Near pole |
| 1.01 | ≈ 1.01 | 101 | Near pole |
| 1.1 | 1.052 | 11.0 | Transition |
| 2.0 | 1.728 | 2.0 | Moderate field |
| 10.0 | 3.649 | 1.111 | Weak field |
| 100.0 | 6.737 | 1.010 | Weak field |

The mapping is smooth and monotonic. Near the horizon, s(r) ≈ 1 + (r - r_s)/r_s (linear). In the weak field, s(r) ≈ log₂(r/r_s) (logarithmic).

## 3.3 The Two Representations of ζ Beyond the Wall

The Riemann zeta function has two distinct representations that agree for Re(s) > 1 but diverge in meaning for s ≤ 1:

**Euler product** (encodes prime structure):
> ∏_p (1 - p⁻ˢ)⁻¹ — converges only for Re(s) > 1

**Analytic continuation** (via functional equation):
> ζ(s) = 2ˢ πˢ⁻¹ sin(πs/2) Γ(1-s) ζ(1-s) — defined for all s ≠ 1

For s < 1, the analytic continuation yields:

| s | ζ(s) | f = 1/ζ(s) | Sign of f |
|---|------|------------|-----------|
| 0.5 | -1.460 | -0.685 | Negative |
| 0.0 | -1/2 | -2.0 | Negative |
| -1.0 | -1/12 | -12.0 | Negative |
| -2.0 | 0 | ∞ | Divergent |
| -3.0 | 1/120 | 120.0 | Positive |
| -4.0 | 0 | ∞ | Divergent |

The sign flip of f for 0 < s < 1 mirrors the time↔space swap that occurs inside the Schwarzschild horizon in standard GR (where g_tt becomes positive and g_rr becomes negative for r < r_s). However, the mechanism is fundamentally different:

- **Standard GR:** f(r) = 1 - r_s/r changes sign continuously through r = r_s.
- **Prime framework:** The Euler product diverges at s = 1; the functional equation provides values with opposite sign for s < 1, but these values are no longer generated by prime factorization.

The trivial zeros of ζ at s = -2, -4, -6, ... (where ζ = 0 and f → ∞) would correspond to discrete shells of metric divergence inside the horizon — a layered interior structure with no analog in standard GR.
