The Kretschner scalar analysis yields a clear classification:

| Test | Result | Implication |
|------|--------|-------------|
| K at horizon | 12/r_s⁴ (finite) | Not a curvature singularity |
| Euler product at s = 1 | Diverges | Prime structure breaks |
| Analytic continuation for s < 1 | Exists (sign-flipped) | Interior accessible only via functional equation |
| Benford delta_B at horizon | ~0.004 (continuous) | Statistical structure preserved (see [Section 6](06-benford-conformance.md)) |

**The wall is a domain boundary, not a curvature singularity.**

This is a third classification of singular behavior in black hole physics:

1. **Coordinate singularity** (standard GR horizon): removable by coordinate transformation. The Kretschner scalar is finite, and the horizon can be crossed.

2. **Curvature singularity** (r = 0): the Kretschner scalar diverges. Physical tidal forces become infinite.

3. **Domain boundary** (prime framework horizon): the Kretschner scalar is finite, but the mathematical structure that generates geometry — the Euler product over primes — ceases to converge. The geometry is well-defined on both sides via different representations of ζ, but only the exterior (s > 1) is built from prime factorization.

The physical interpretation: the event horizon is where the "prime order" of spacetime geometry ends. Outside, gravity emerges from the multiplicative structure of prime numbers. At the horizon, that structure reaches its limit. Beyond, only the analytic continuation — a formal mathematical extension without prime-generative meaning — describes the geometry.
