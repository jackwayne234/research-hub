# Riner Research Hub

A personal research dashboard for CJ (Christopher Jack Wayne Riner) and his AI thinking partner Barron.

## What Is This?

A single-page, self-contained HTML file that serves as a living hub for all of CJ and Barron's research work together — from Benford physics to the 5D prime-modified metric, math journey tracking, publications, and speculative ideas.

## Usage

Open `index.html` directly in any browser. No build step, no dependencies, no server required.

The only external resource is Google Fonts (JetBrains Mono). Everything else is inline.
