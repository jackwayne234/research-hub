## 9.1 The Measurement Problem Reframed

The double-slit experiment is the canonical demonstration of wave-particle duality: unobserved photons produce an interference pattern (wavelike), but observed photons produce two bands (particlelike). The standard interpretation invokes "wave function collapse" — a discontinuous, unexplained transition.

The mass-quantum spectrum from [Section 8](08-benford-epsilon.md) suggests an alternative: **measurement increases δ_B.**

When a photon travels through the slits unobserved:
- The system has low δ_B → bosonic/wavelike character dominates
- The photon's metric values follow Benford's Law closely
- Interference occurs because the system is in the quantum end of the spectrum

When a detector is introduced:
- The detector-photon interaction increases the system's Benford deviation
- δ_B rises → the system slides toward the massive/fermionic end of the spectrum
- Particlelike behavior emerges because the system is now further from pure Benford conformance
- The interference pattern disappears — not because of "collapse," but because of a continuous shift in mass-quantum character

## 9.2 Why Observation Increases δ_B

The connection is thermodynamic. A detector introduces:
- **Additional degrees of freedom** (detector particles, electrons in the CCD, photomultiplier atoms)
- **Thermal noise** (the detector operates at T > 0)
- **Information extraction** (the which-path measurement removes phase coherence)

Each of these pushes the combined system away from the purely bosonic (completely monotone, perfectly Benford-conforming) state toward the fermionic (alternating, Benford-deviating) state. The BEC paper showed this explicitly: thermal fluctuations in Fermi-Dirac systems produce Benford deviations with amplitude governed by η(s). Introducing a detector couples the photon to a fermionic bath (the detector's electrons), and the combined system's δ_B rises.

## 9.3 Testable Prediction

The prime framework predicts that:

1. **δ_B should be measurable in the double-slit experiment.** Collect the leading digits of all physical quantities in the system (photon energy, momentum, detector voltages, path lengths) and compute δ_B. The prediction: δ_B will be lower when interference is observed and higher when which-path detection is active.

2. **The transition should be continuous.** Partial which-path detection (e.g., weak measurement) should produce intermediate δ_B values and partial interference patterns. This is already observed experimentally — the Englert-Greenberger duality relation quantifies the tradeoff between path distinguishability D and visibility V: D² + V² ≤ 1. The prediction is that δ_B correlates with D (distinguishability), not V (visibility).

3. **The threshold is not arbitrary.** The bridge factor ε_B = |1 - 2^(1-s)| from the BEC paper predicts the exact scale at which the transition occurs. For a photon (bosonic, s related to its energy), ε_B gives the natural scale of mass-quantum mixing.

## 9.4 Implications

If confirmed, this would mean:

- **Wave function collapse is not a fundamental process.** It is a continuous slide along the mass-quantum spectrum, driven by the increase in Benford deviation when a quantum system couples to a massive (fermionic) detector.
- **The measurement problem is a Benford problem.** "Why does observation change the outcome?" becomes "Why does coupling to a detector increase δ_B?" — and the BEC paper answers this: fermionic systems have nonzero Benford deviation by mathematical necessity.
- **Consciousness is irrelevant.** The δ_B increase is a property of the boson-fermion coupling, not of the observer's awareness. Any fermionic system (a rock, a Geiger counter, a cat) would increase δ_B equally.
