# GPS Validation

## Summary
Three methods compared hour-by-hour over 24 hours UTC: standard GR (g_tt), β parameter, and ζ-modified g_tt. All converge on 38.6 μs/day. Adding ζ to the metric doesn't break the most precisely measured gravitational effect.

## Key Results
- All three methods agree to within measurement precision
- No time-dependent artifacts — match holds at every hour, not just average
- Critical validation: the prime-modified metric is compatible with weak-field tests

## Connections
- Paper 5 (River Velocity) — environmental data validates Benford methods
- Paper 7 (GR Emergence) — GPS match confirms prime framework in weak field

## Open Questions
- Extend to GRACE/GRACE-FO satellite data for stronger-field tests?
- Lunar laser ranging as independent validation?
