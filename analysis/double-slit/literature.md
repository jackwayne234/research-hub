# Double-Slit Literature Review — External Research

> **Role**: You are a literature analyst cross-referencing the Benford double-slit energy hypothesis against the existing academic record. You identify supporting evidence, opposing evidence, and open gaps with equal rigor.

**Date:** February 26, 2026
**Purpose:** Catalog existing research relevant to the energy hypothesis (Section 14) and the broader Benford/zeta framework.

## Summary

The literature reveals a **tension** at the heart of the energy hypothesis:

- **FOR (energy matters):** The Elouard/Jordan group has proven that quantum measurement necessarily exchanges energy ("quantum heat") and can even power engines. Destroying coherence costs work. Landauer's principle is verified experimentally.
- **AGAINST (information suffices):** Interaction-free measurements detect objects without energy exchange. Quantum erasers recover interference retroactively. The Englert inequality and entropic uncertainty relations are purely informational.
- **SYNTHESIS:** Paper C9 (Elouard 2020) suggests energy changes are a *consequence* of informational collapse, not the cause. Both views may be correct at different levels of description.

## A. Energy Cost of Quantum Measurement

These papers support the hypothesis that observation involves real energy exchange.

### A1. Elouard, Herrera-Marti, Clusel & Auffeves (2016)
**"The role of quantum measurement in stochastic thermodynamics"**
npj Quantum Information | arXiv: 1607.02404 | 199 citations

Introduces **"quantum heat"** — energy exchanged purely by measurement back-action. Measuring any observable that doesn't commute with the Hamiltonian necessarily changes the system's energy. This energy change is not work and is not thermal — it is a distinct thermodynamic quantity generated by observation itself.

**Relevance:** The most directly supportive paper. Mathematically demonstrates that observation performs an energetic transaction. The wave-to-particle transition is accompanied by quantifiable energy exchange.

### A2. Latune & Elouard (2024)
**"A thermodynamically consistent approach to the energy costs of quantum measurements"**
Quantum | arXiv: 2402.16037 | 12 citations

Derives the **minimum work required** to perform a quantum measurement from a complete microscopic model. The cost depends on the system's energy change plus information-theoretic quantities. Faster measurements cost more energy.

**Relevance:** Provides quantitative machinery to calculate exactly how much energy a measurement costs.

### A3. Jordan, Elouard & Auffeves (2019)
**"Quantum measurement engines and their relevance for quantum interpretations"**
arXiv: 1911.06838 | 44 citations

Measurement can serve as **fuel for a heat engine**. The energy injected by measurement back-action can be harvested to do useful work, with no thermal bath required. Key statement: "Any quantum measurement of an observable that does not commute with the Hamiltonian will necessarily change the energy of the system."

**Relevance:** If measurement energy can power an engine, observation is a genuine energy-exchange process.

### A4. Czupryniak, Bhandari, Erdman & Jordan (2026)
**"Universal Characterization of Quantum Vacuum Measurement Engines"**
arXiv: 2602.03706 | Brand new

Measurement injects energy even when the system starts in the **ground state** (vacuum). The "quantum vacuum bending function" characterizes how measurements change ground-state energy. Observation always involves energy exchange — there is no way to "look" at a quantum system for free.

**Relevance:** Most recent paper in this line. Measurement energy injection is universal.

### A5. Sanchez, Singh, Jordan & Bhandari (2025)
**"Making the Virtual Real: Measurement-Powered Tunneling Engines"**
arXiv: 2510.22394 | 4 citations

Position measurement on a tunneling electron forces it from "virtual" (classically forbidden) energy to "real" energy above the barrier. The energy is supplied by measurement interaction. Vivid example: observation converts quantum behavior (tunneling = wavelike) into classical behavior (definite position = particlelike), with a precise energy cost.

### A6. Kammerlander & Anders (2015)
**"Coherence and measurement in quantum thermodynamics"**
Scientific Reports | arXiv: 1502.02673 | 188 citations

Projective measurements carry a **work cost that exists only for quantum states with coherences**. Classical states do not incur this cost. Destroying coherence (the wave-like property) specifically costs energy.

**Relevance:** The energy cost is uniquely tied to the quantum-to-classical transition.

### A7. Yan et al. (2018)
**"Single-atom demonstration of quantum Landauer principle"**
Physical Review Letters | arXiv: 1803.10424 | 92 citations

First experimental verification of Landauer's principle in a **single quantum system** (trapped ion). Erasing one quantum bit dissipates at least kT·ln(2) of energy.

### A8. Berut et al. (2012)
**"Experimental verification of Landauer's principle"**
Nature | 1,084 citations

Landmark experiment establishing that information and energy are physically linked. Erasing one bit costs kT·ln(2) minimum.

### A9. Coles, Kaniewski & Wehner (2014)
**"Equivalence of wave-particle duality to entropic uncertainty"**
Nature Communications | arXiv: 1403.4687 | 124 citations

Wave-particle duality is mathematically equivalent to entropic uncertainty relations. Since entropy is thermodynamically linked to energy via Landauer's principle, this provides the chain: observation → information → entropy → energy.

### A10. Batelaan, Jones, Huang & Bach (2020)
**"Momentum exchange in the electron double-slit experiment"**
arXiv: 2012.02141

Experimental evidence that momentum is conserved for individual events in the double-slit experiment. A physical mechanism must be responsible for the momentum exchange that produces the interference pattern.

## B. Interaction-Free Measurements (Challenges to Energy Hypothesis)

These papers support the information-based interpretation and challenge the idea that energy exchange is the primary mechanism.

### B1. Elitzur & Vaidman (1993)
**"Quantum Mechanical Interaction-Free Measurements"**
Foundations of Physics | arXiv: hep-th/9305002 | 632 citations

The original bomb tester. An object's presence can be detected **without any particle ever interacting with it**. The photon never touches the bomb, yet interference is destroyed.

**Challenge:** No energy exchanged in successful detection cases, yet interference is lost.

### B2. Scully, Englert & Walther (1991)
**"Quantum Optical Tests of Complementarity"**
Nature | 728 citations

Which-way detector records path information **without any momentum kick** to the atom. Interference disappears purely because which-path information becomes correlated with the detector state (entanglement). Interference recoverable by "erasing" the information.

**Challenge:** Explicitly rules out the "uncontrollable momentum transfer" (energy-based) explanation.

### B3. Englert (1996)
**"Fringe Visibility and Which-Way Information: An Inequality"**
Physical Review Letters | 668 citations

V² + D² ≤ 1, where V = fringe visibility and D = which-way distinguishability. Purely information-theoretic — makes no reference to energy exchange.

### B4. Kim, Yu, Kulik, Shih & Scully (2000)
**"Delayed 'Choice' Quantum Eraser"**
Physical Review Letters | arXiv: quant-ph/9903047 | 495 citations

Which-path information erased **after** the signal photon is already detected, retroactively recovering interference in correlations. If interference loss were caused by energy disturbance, it could not be undone retroactively.

**Challenge:** Strongest evidence against pure energy interpretation. Retroactive erasure is incompatible with an irreversible energy extraction.

### B5. Walborn, Terra Cunha, Padua & Monken (2002)
**"Double-Slit Quantum Eraser"**
Physical Review A | arXiv: quant-ph/0106078 | 276 citations

Quarter-wave plates mark paths via polarization entanglement (no momentum kicks). Interference loss and recovery controlled entirely by information extractability.

### B6. Kwiat et al. (1999)
**"High-Efficiency Quantum Interrogation via Quantum Zeno Effect"**
Physical Review Letters | arXiv: quant-ph/9909083 | 163 citations

IFM efficiency pushed to 73% (85% feasible) via repeated interrogation. As cycles increase, probability of energy exchange → 0, yet detection certainty → 1.

**Challenge:** Information acquired with vanishing energy cost.

### B7. Robens, Alt, Emary, Meschede & Alberti (2017)
**"Atomic Bomb Testing: Elitzur-Vaidman Violates Leggett-Garg"**
Applied Physics B | arXiv: 1609.06218 | 57 citations

IFM implemented with single cesium atom. Leggett-Garg violation confirms no hidden classical variable (including energy kick) can explain results.

### B8. Vaidman (2000)
**"Are Interaction-Free Measurements Interaction Free?"**
arXiv: quant-ph/0006077 | 16 citations

Vaidman's own reassessment. The wavefunction does reach the object even when the particle does not. "Interaction-free" is valid for local energy exchange, but the wavefunction (information) explores the object's location.

### B9. Elouard, Waegell, Huard & Jordan (2020)
**"An Interaction-Free Quantum Measurement-Driven Engine"**
Foundations of Physics | arXiv: 1904.09289 | 15 citations

**THE BRIDGE PAPER.** A quantum engine extracts work from IFMs. The "bomb" has its energy changed by measurement **even when the photon never enters that arm**. Energy transfer is nonlocal.

**Synthesis:** Information-based collapse CAN produce energy changes as a consequence. The energy is real but follows from the informational process, not the other way around. This suggests: information is the cause, energy is the effect — but both are present.

### B10. Mori & Tsutsui (2015)
**"Weak Value and the Wave-Particle Duality"**
arXiv: 1410.0787 | 10 citations

Weak measurements access partial information without full collapse. The amount of information extracted (not probe energy) determines how much interference is preserved.

## C. Benford's Law in Physics

### C1. Sen(De) & Sen (2011)
**"Benford's law detects quantum phase transitions similarly as earthquakes"**
EPL | arXiv: 1103.5398 | 23 citations

Benford deviation in quantum observables (magnetization, entanglement) detects **quantum phase transitions** at zero temperature. Deviation from Benford = signature of cooperative quantum phenomena.

**Relevance:** Directly establishes Benford deviation as a quantum diagnostic — the same use as in our framework.

### C2. Rane, Mishra, Biswas, Sen(De) & Sen (2014)
**"Benford's law gives better scaling exponents in phase transitions"**
Physical Review E | arXiv: 1405.2744 | 6 citations

Benford analysis yields superior finite-size scaling exponents for detecting quantum critical points compared to conventional order parameters. High-precision detection from low-precision data.

### C3. Bera, Mishra, Roy, Biswas & De (2018)
**"Benford analysis of quantum critical phenomena"**
Physics Letters A | arXiv: 1711.00758 | 1 citation

First significant digit captures nearly all critical information. Additional digits provide diminishing returns.

### C4. Burke & Kincanon (1991)
**"Benford's law and physical constants"**
American Journal of Physics | 63 citations

Fundamental physical constants obey Benford's law. One of the earliest systematic tests.

### C5. Cong, Li & Ma (2019)
**"First digit law from Laplace transform"**
Physics Letters A | arXiv: 1905.00352 | 3 citations

Derives Benford's law from the Laplace transform. The connection to integral transforms parallels the Mellin transform structure of ζ(s).

## D. Riemann Zeta Function in Quantum Physics

### D1. Berry & Keating (1999)
**"The Riemann Zeros and Eigenvalue Asymptotics"**
SIAM Review | 124 citations

Foundational Berry-Keating conjecture: zeta zeros are eigenvalues of a quantum Hamiltonian obtained by quantizing H = xp. The primes correspond to periodic orbits of this Hamiltonian.

### D2. LeClair & Mussardo (2023)
**"Riemann zeros as quantized energies of scattering with impurities"**
JHEP | arXiv: 2307.01254 | 3 citations

The **Euler product is a unitarity condition** for a physical S-matrix. Primes become scattering centers. Functions without Euler products (Davenport-Heilbronn) have zeros off the critical line — the Euler product IS what keeps the structure intact.

**Relevance:** Directly supports using the Euler product as a physical tensor. The prime factorization isn't metaphorical — it's a unitarity constraint.

### D3. Hartnoll & Yang (2025)
**"The conformal primon gas at the end of time"**
JHEP | arXiv: 2502.02661 | 9 citations

Maps gravity near a spacelike singularity onto a **"primon gas"** where the Hilbert space factorizes over primes via the Euler product. Each prime provides a tensor factor of the cosmological Hilbert space.

**Relevance:** Extremely relevant. Primes encoding gravitational structure near singularities — the Euler product appearing as the Hilbert space decomposition of gravity itself.

### D4. Godet (2025)
**"Mobius randomness in the Hartle-Hawking state"**
arXiv: 2505.03068 | 5 citations

The Hartle-Hawking no-boundary wavefunction for toroidal universes involves a **sum over Riemann zeta zeros**. Near-Planckian behavior of the wavefunction is governed by the distribution of zeta zeros.

**Relevance:** Zeta zeros appearing in the wavefunction of the universe itself.

### D5. Tamburini (2025)
**"Majorana particle spectrum in Rindler spacetime encoded by zeta"**
arXiv: 2503.09644 | 1 citation

Zeta zeros realized as energy eigenvalues of a Majorana particle in Rindler spacetime (near-horizon geometry). Connects primes/zeta directly to gravitational horizons.

### D6. Sierra & Townsend (2008)
**"Landau levels and Riemann zeros"**
Physical Review Letters | arXiv: 0805.4079 | 54 citations

Explicit physical realization of Hilbert-Polya using Landau levels. Zeta zeros emerge from quantized motion in a magnetic field.

### D7. Yakaboylu (2024)
**"Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-Polya conjecture"**
Journal of Physics A | arXiv: 2309.00405 | 2 citations

Direct construction of the Hilbert-Polya operator with boundary conditions tied to zeta zeros.

### D8. Kalauni & Milton (2023)
**"Supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the Riemann hypothesis"**
arXiv: 2211.04382 | 4 citations

SUSY model where Hamiltonian eigenvalues are products of zeta functions. Zeta zeros correspond to vanishing ground state energies. SUSY naturally incorporates bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom.

## E. Assessment — Where We Stand

### The Energy Hypothesis is Supported But Incomplete

**What works:**
- Measurement necessarily exchanges energy (A1, A3, A4) — proven mathematically, demonstrated with engines
- Destroying coherence specifically costs work (A6) — the wave-to-particle transition has an energy price
- Landauer's principle links information to energy (A7, A8) — every bit of which-path information has an energy cost
- The chain observation → information → entropy → energy is formally established (A9)

**What challenges it:**
- Interaction-free measurements acquire information without local energy exchange (B1, B6, B7)
- Quantum erasers undo interference loss retroactively (B4, B5) — incompatible with irreversible energy extraction
- The Englert inequality V² + D² ≤ 1 is purely informational (B3)

**The synthesis (from B9):**
Energy changes are a **consequence** of informational collapse, not the cause. Both are present in every measurement, but the causal arrow is: information → energy, not energy → information. The energy hypothesis is correct that energy is exchanged, but incomplete if it claims energy is the primary mechanism.

### The Benford/Zeta Framework Has Emerging Support

**Strong support:**
- Benford deviation detects quantum phase transitions (C1, C2, C3) — validating δ_B as a quantum diagnostic
- The Euler product is a physical unitarity condition (D2) — not metaphorical
- Primes factorize the Hilbert space of gravity near singularities (D3) — "primon gas"
- Zeta zeros appear in cosmological wavefunctions (D4) and near-horizon physics (D5)
- Berry-Keating provides the Hamiltonian interpretation (D1)

**No existing work does what this framework does:**
- No paper uses the Euler product as a metric tensor component (g_rr = ζ(s))
- No paper connects Benford deviation to the boson-fermion bridge via η(s) = ε_B·ζ(s)
- No paper uses δ_B as a mass-quantum spectrum diagnostic in the double-slit context
- The prime cascade zone (per-prime crossing of bridge factors) is novel
