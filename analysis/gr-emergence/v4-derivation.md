# GR Emergence — v4 Derivation

## Summary
General relativity emerges from the Riemann zeta function. The Schwarzschild metric is g_tt = −1/ζ(s), g_rr = ζ(s), with ζ(s) × 1/ζ(s) = 1 encoding flat spacetime as the multiplicative identity. Curvature arises when the Euler product deviates from this identity.

## Key Results
- s(r) = 1 + (r/r_s)³ with α = 3 — empirically constrained, not free — reproduces standard Schwarzschild to machine precision
- Euler product ∏(1−p⁻ˢ)⁻¹ diverges at s = 1 (horizon) — domain boundary, not curvature singularity
- v4 adds BEC bridge: bosonic gravity (ζ) vs fermionic matter (η) via η(s) = (1 - 2^(1-s))·ζ(s), linking Paper 7 to Paper 2
- All 4 versions reproduce GPS 38.6 μs/day

## Evolution
- **v1** — Proof of concept: direct ζ construction
- **v2** — Chebyshev ψ(x) via Riemann explicit formula, more rigorous
- **v3** — Inverse relationship framing: is s(r) natural or tuned?
- **v4** — Full derivation with boson-fermion bridge (paper-ready)

## Open Questions
- Is α = 3 derivable from first principles or a boundary condition?
- How does the Euler product behave for Kerr (rotating) black holes?
