# Metric Structure — Embedding Comparison

## Summary
Two approaches for where ζ lives in the metric: embedded into all 4 components vs tracked as a separate scalar factor. Both reproduce weak-field physics. They diverge only at the horizon.

## Key Results
- Embedded and factored approaches both match GPS 38.6 μs/day
- Divergence only at s → 1, where the Euler product hits its convergence boundary
- Pure 4D confirmed — ζ modifies existing metric, no extra dimensions needed
- Solar-mass and Sgr A* tested — prime metric matches standard GR in exterior region

## Decisions
- Committed to embedded approach (ζ into g_tt and g_rr) for Paper 7
- Kept zenodo_zeta_4d_pure.py as submission-ready copy

## Open Questions
- Does the factored approach have advantages for Kerr metric?
- Should zenodo_zeta_4d_pure.py be retired as a duplicate?
